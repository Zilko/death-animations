# Death Animations

Go to the Garage and tap the cool spike button on the left to choose the animation that will play when you die.

The spike represents the hundreds of hours I spent dying in the first spike of Stereo Madness while making these animations!

The spike invites you to die.

I will take any Death Animation suggestions, they can be original ideas!
